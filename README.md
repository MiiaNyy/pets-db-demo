# MongoDB and Express exercise
This was a small project where I practice Node.js Express http requests and MongoDB database.

In the site user can browse, add new, update or delete database documents. 

## What I learned

    - How to create environmental variables and how to hide them from source code
    - How to update existing documents, add new documents to database and delete them as well
- How to listen different kinds of requests and send responses
- How to create url parameters and how to access them using Express
- How to use Handlebars and create dynamic pages using Express
